# Contributing

## The Basics

This project uses the "GitHub Flow" branching model. If you would like to read more on various branching models,
the two major contenders in the room are the [GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) and the
[Gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model.

## Running Tests

The most important part of changes are their tests. Every new feature or issue being fixed should have a matching test.
When you write your tests, please make sure they're in line with the existing tests.

## Bug Reports

If you discover a bug in the documentation or the code, please follow the process below to help us out.

- Search the existing issues to see if the issue has already been filed
- Make sure the issue is a bug and not simply a preference
- If you have found a new issue, please file it

From that point, if you are interested in contributing some code, ask in the issue if we are willing to accept a failing
test case and/or a fix. If we are, then follow the steps for contributing, and we can go from there!

## Feature Requests

Every new feature request will be scrutinized to make sure we are not going to experience feature bloat. Every new
feature should fit the Vision for the project. If you have an idea for a new feature and feel it fits the vision, file
an issue, and we can discuss it.

Make sure any feature request you make fits the [INVEST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic)) mnemonic.

## Pull Requests

A well written pull request is a huge piece of the success of any open source project. Please make sure to take the
time to think out the request and document/comment well. A good pull request should be the smallest successful
feature, akin to the [INVEST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic)) mnemonic used in scrum.

Make sure if you are not a project member and just getting started that you have a related issue for your Pull Request
and that a project owner approves the work before putting the effort in to make the change. Most of the time as long as
you are following the project vision, we'll welcome additions, but it is better to be safe than sorry.

Also, make sure your pull request is built with a compilation of great
[commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

The [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) project has awesome instructions for Pull
Requests, I have added a copy here.

Adhering to the following this process is the best way to get your work included in the project:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/xbar-whats-up
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd xbar-whats-up
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/sprak3000/xbar-whats-up
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Make sure to update, or add to the tests when appropriate. Patches and features will not be accepted without tests.
   Run `make test` to make sure all tests pass after you've made changes.

5. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit message guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   or your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

6. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream master
   ```

7. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

8. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
   with a clear title and description.

9. If you are asked to amend your changes before they can be merged in, please
   use `git commit --amend` (or rebasing for multi-commit Pull Requests) and
   force push to your remote feature branch. You may also be asked to squash
   commits.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to license your work under the same license as that used by the project.
